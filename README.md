## Nodium Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Integration

#### Milestone 1: Protocol and Backend Architecture

- Define communication protocol, data formats, and API endpoints.
- Design modular backend architecture with Rust and dynamic plugin loading.
- Implement core services, node execution engine, and database integration.

#### Milestone 2: CLI Tool Implementation

- Develop commands for flow and plugin management, node operations, and configuration setup.
- Implement flow execution, monitoring, debugging, and general configuration commands.

#### Milestone 3: Integration with Minecraft, Godot, Tauri

- Enable in-game file manipulation and node interaction interfaces.

### Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities and Plugin Ecosystem

#### Milestone 4: Expand Core Features and Plugin Ecosystem

- Implement file nodes, database support, and basic math operations.
- Release community plugins, establish a marketplace, and iterate based on user feedback.

#### Milestone 5: Data Analysis, IoT, and Visual Interface Enhancements

- Implement machine learning, web dashboard tools, IoT nodes, and real-time data processing.
- Enhance the node-based interface, enable flow saving/reuse, and optimize for usability.

#### Milestone 6: UX Optimizations and Mobile Integration

- Optimize UI/UX, streamline workflows, and develop mobile versions for iOS and Android with accessibility in mind.

## Applications

For Nodium to be accessible, it will need a dynamic solution for using it.  
Nodium itself will be a backend architecture like [PIPEWIRE](https://pipewire.org/), and it will have different view applications.

### CLI Application

All functionalities should be available as CLI commands to make it easy for Linux users to adopt.

### Minecraft Mod

A Minecraft JAVA and BEDROCK mod would provide the opportunity to creatively start developing on the backend.

#### Control Minecraft With Arduino (YT Video)

### Tauri (Rust): React + TypeScript

The desktop application would be the solution for primary companies and people who prefer a flat layout like [NodeRED](https://github.com/node-red/node-red).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

### Godot 3D Game

It will be a game with plugins for reading files on PC, like audio, which will then be visible in 3D as a vinyl, for example, and in-game you can do anything with it. It will be like Garry's Mod!
